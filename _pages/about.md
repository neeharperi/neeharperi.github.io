Towards Open World Visual Understanding
=====

I'm a first year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute. I'm interested in developing algorithms that can generalize (Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning) with less supervision (Self-Supervised Learning) and (Long-Tail) data. My work uses computer vision and machine learning to improve the robustness and scalability of learning-based perception.

I am advised by [Dr. Deva Ramanan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/) at Carnegie Mellon University. As an undergraduate at the University of Maryland, I was actively involved in research under the guidance of [Dr. Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/faculty/rama-chellappa/) and [Dr. John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com). Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on several projects relating to:
- Vehicle Re-Identification
- Traffic Anomaly Detection
- Defending Against Clean-Label Adversarial Attacks
- Human-in-the-Loop Learning for Auction Design
- Cross-Modal Face Synthesis and Verification
- 3D Object Detection, Tracking, and Forecasting for Autonomous Vehicles

Get in touch if you'd like to learn more about my work!
