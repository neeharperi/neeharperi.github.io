3D Perception for Robotics
=====

I am a _final year_ PhD candidate advised by [Deva Ramanan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/) at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute. I am supported in part by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
 
### Research 
My research focuses on developing 3D foundation models for robot perception. Current 2D foundation models trained on multi-modal internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot accuracy across a variety of 2D perception tasks. However, extending such foundation models for 3D perception remains challenging due to a lack of diverse large-scale 3D training data. To bridge this gap, my work leverages 2D foundation models and geometric priors to generate 3D pseudo-labels, allowing us to turn any 2D dataset into a 3D dataset!
