Towards Open World Visual Understanding
=====

I'm a first year PhD student at the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute. I'm currently interested in working on generative models, self-supervised learning and open-world visual understanding with the goal of creating domain invariant intelligent perception systems that can generalize to the long tail of unseen data.

As an undergraduate at the University of Maryland, I was actively involved in research under the guidance of [Dr. Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/faculty/rama-chellappa/) and [Dr. John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com). I also collaborate with [Dr. Deva Ramanan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/) at Carnegie Mellon University. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on several projects relating to vehicle re-identification, traffic anomaly detection, adversarial machine learning, auction design, multi-modal face synthesis, and 3D object detection, tracking, and forecasting for autonomous vehicles.

Get in touch if you'd like to learn more about my work!
