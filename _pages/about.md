Towards Open World Visual Understanding
=====

I'm a senior at the University of Maryland interested in pursuing a research career in computer vision and machine learning. I'm currently interested in working on self-supervised learning and open-set visual understanding with the goal of creating systems that can generalize to the long tail of unseen data, specifically to create truly flexible, domain invariant intelligent perception systems.

I have focused my undergraduate study as a computer engineering student learning about signal processing, probability theory, data science, traditional machine learning and computer vision. In addition to my coursework, I have actively pursued research at the University of Maryland under the guidance of [Dr. Rama Chellappa](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~rama/) and [Dr. John Dickerson](jpdickerson.com). Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on several projects relating to vehicle re-identification, traffic anomaly detection, adversarial machine learning, large-scale facial recognition, and open world 3D tracking for applications in self-driving vehicles.

Get in touch if you'd like to learn more about my work!
