Hey There! Nice to Meet You
=====

I'm a senior at the University of Maryland interested in pursuing a research career in computer vision and machine learning. I'm fascinated by computer vision due to its enormous reach and potential impact. I'm currently interested in working on self-supervised learning, with the goal of creating systems that can understand the world through causal reasoning. The standard learning pipeline leverages an astronomical amount of labeled data, and is still unable to generalize to the long tail of unseen data. Self-supervised learning attempts to soften the need for human-annotated labels by leveraging multimodal sensor data to find patterns in the data itself. I believe that self-supervised learning is a key component in creating truly flexible, domain invariant intelligent perception systems.

I have focused my undergraduate study as a computer engineering student learning about signal processing, probability theory, data science, and traditional machine learning’s influence on computer vision. In addition to my coursework, I have actively pursued research at the University of Maryland under the guidance of Dr. Rama Chellappa and Dr. John Dickerson. I’ve had the opportunity to work on several projects relating to vehicle re-identification, traffic anomaly detection, adversarial machine learning, large-scale facial recognition, and open world 3D tracking for self-driving vehicles.
