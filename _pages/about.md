Towards Open World Visual Understanding
=====

I'm a senior at the University of Maryland interested in pursuing a research career in computer vision and machine learning. I'm currently interested in working on generative models, self-supervised learning and open-world visual understanding with the goal of creating systems that can generalize to the long tail of unseen data, specifically to create truly flexible, domain invariant intelligent perception systems.

I'm actively involved in research at the University of Maryland under the guidance of [Dr. Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/faculty/rama-chellappa/) and [Dr. John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com). I'm currently collaborating with [Dr. Deva Ramanan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/) at Carnegie Mellon University. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on several projects relating to vehicle re-identification, traffic anomaly detection, adversarial machine learning, multi-modal facial recognition, and open-world 3D tracking.

Get in touch if you'd like to learn more about my work!
