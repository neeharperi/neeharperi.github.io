From 3D Perception to 4D Simulation
=====

I am a third year PhD student working on [Computer Vision](http://vision.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm interested in developing algorithms that can generalize (few-shot and zero-shot learning) with less supervision (self-supervised learning) and (long-tail) data. My current work with the [Center for Autonomous Vehicle Research](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/argo-ai-center/) focuses on building robust 3D perception algorithms for detection, tracking, forecasting, and simulation. I am supported in part by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

I am advised by [Deva Ramanan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/) at the Robotics Institute. As an undergraduate at the University of Maryland, I was involved in research under the guidance of [Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/faculty/rama-chellappa/) and [John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com).
